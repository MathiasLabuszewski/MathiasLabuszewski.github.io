I bought a jet ski! Just kidding I was given it by my neighbor. He has had a 1999 Kawasaki Super Sport Jet Ski under a tarp in his backyard for as long as I can remember, and one day working in the garage I asked, "Can I have that". And he said YES! What I didn't know was the mess I was getting into.

The ski never ran 100% right and wasn't as fast as it should be. There wasn't too much to get it running, just a new battery and some new fuel lines and it purred to life. (kinda). I took it to the lake with my neighbor who now owns a boat, hence why he abandoned the jetski. The ski would only get to ~33mph and would not rev out. Something was wrong. As we were getting ready to head in disaster stuck. The impeller was colliding with the jet pump. It killed the motor and when I tried to start it, it would die seconds later. What had really happened, is the impeller just screwed itself off the bearing shaft. It was free floating in the jet pump housing. After I got home, I took the pump off and looked at the damage. The pump housing had two massive chips in it, and the impeller was massively dented. It had gouged massive chunks out of two of the housing fins (fins that counteract the rotational torque generated by the impeller). The housing was aluminum, and I have an aluminum tig welder, so I tried my best.

The weld had worked, the casting was not full of too many impurities and it blended in. I assembled the whole pump assembly and put new seals and bearings in.

I was going to reinstall the jet pump and decided to take a look at the bottom of the hull. After some not-so-close inspection, I could tell the hull was massively damaged. There were 4 massive holes in the hull, and they had all been patched really shortly. Water was even getting in one. This is the other reason the ski was not so fast. So I took it upon myself to fix the hull. I gutted the jetski, and strapped up the ski to my neighbor's car lift, and flipped the ski over. 
I made a plastic bubble to contain all the dust and suited up. I ground off all the old patches and ruined the gel coat and top layer of fiberglass. After all the sanding there were about 9 holes that needed patching. I decided to use fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin. Originally the hull was made of polyester resin and fiberglass matt. The epoxy and fiberglass cloth is about 20x stronger. I went thru about a gallon of two-part total boat epoxy. There was lots of sanding, but eventually, I restored the hull. All I needed to do was gel coat it.

After gel coating, I got back to installing the guts of the ski. While the engine and exhaust were out, I decided to do some modifications. I removed the exhaust baffles so the flow would be less impeded, and installed a high compression head kit. The carbs were also rebuilt. I had lots of problems with the carbs on the ski. Because this is a marine application, the carbs cannot be open to the atmosphere, or else fuel vapors would build up in the hull. They use the pulsating of the engine vacuum to pump fuel down to the engine. (jumping timeline) I went through 4 carb rebuild kits and a bunch of troubleshooting and finally, after a bunch of testing, I got it to work. Each kit had slightly different tolerances in its metering spring, gaskets, and needles. It turned out that one of the problems was some of the mechanic parts had gone out of spec, so I had to make some new parts for the carb and it finally worked like it should. (back to the timeline). I rebuilt the carbs and converted the engine from oil injection to premix. After all the parts went back in I was ready to hit the water. It ran super well and smokes like a healthy two-stoke should.
