My name is Mathias Labuszewski. I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering Student at CU Boulder. I love what I do, and I love learning. Here are a few of my skills and qualities:
- Technical Proficiency: Skilled in C programming, Verilog, STM32 microcontrollers, FPGA development, and hardware interfacing.
- Problem-Solving: Effective troubleshooter with a strong ability to identify and resolve technical issues.
- Mentorship and Teaching: Experienced in guiding and supporting students in coding, project development, and understanding complex technical concepts.
- Innovative Project Development: Demonstrated track record of successfully designing, developing, and assembling a range of electronic systems, including robots, ham radios, and embedded software projects.

  
I have lots of hobbies; I like to fly my racing drones around, I love to motocross, and I love making things.
