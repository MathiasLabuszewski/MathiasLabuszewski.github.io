subtitle: Collection of my Board reports

Here is a collection of the 4 board reports from my PCB Design and Manufacturing class. Only one board has been fully built, tested and analyzed, so only one report is up. You can refer to the Lab Reports to see what we are learning about in the class.

### Board 1
This board was a simple 555 timer board. The purpose was to familiarise students with Altium Designer, and assembling SMD components.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
